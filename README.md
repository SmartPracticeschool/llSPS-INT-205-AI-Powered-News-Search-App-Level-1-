AI Powered News Search App (Level-1)

**INTRODUCTION**

The web is home to massive amounts of data, with more being created every day.
Enriched news data can help your application make dynamic connections across current events faster

 **PURPOSE:**  
The purpose of this project is to build a user friendly News Search Application which makes it easier for the users to find relevant news articles according to their interests and queries. All we need to do is give relevant keywords regarding the required news to the chatbot so that it can fetch the news articles and links.  This app also determines the sentiment of the article.
Software Designing:
In order to build this app, the following things are need to be done:
1. Build a Server Side Application using Node-RED.
2. Use the pre-built Watson Discovery News collection.
3. Access the Watson Discovery Service through the Discovery API.
4. Use a Slack interface to query the data.
5. Push news alerts out to web notification.
6. Deploy the app on IBM Cloud.

**PROJECT FLOW**
The user interacts with the app UI(Built with Node-RED or Cloud or Local) to request relevant news content.
